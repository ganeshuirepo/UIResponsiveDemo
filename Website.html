	    <p> We present you best Material Design Templates HTML5 Collection in 2018. Enjoy!
Material design (codenamed quantum paper) is a design language developed by Google and announced at the Google I/O conference on June 25, 2014. Expanding upon the “card” motifs first seen in Google Now, it is a design with increased use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows. Designer Matías Duarte explained that “unlike real paper, our digital material can expand and reform intelligently. Material has physical surfaces and edges. Seams and shadows provide meaning about what you can touch.” Google states that their new design language is based on paper and ink.
<br/>Material Design is a specification for a unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices and different screen sizes. Color in material design is inspired by bold hues juxtaposed with muted environments, deep shadows, and bright highlights. Material takes cues from contemporary architecture, road signs, pavement marking tape, and athletic courts. Color should be unexpected and vibrant. Material Design is good fit in combination with Bootstrap Templates and AngularJS Framework, and these days lots people create Materialize CSS Templates with Front End Materilize Framework
